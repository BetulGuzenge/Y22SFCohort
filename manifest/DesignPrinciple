Design principle of the org or project:

- A big project usualluy will have PRO CODE approach. ( Means instead of flow they prefer to write codes )
    -They will  not combine flow and trigger . 
    -Deployement strategy
        -Dev (sandbox)
        -QA (sandbox)
        -UAT (user acceptance) Full Copy Sandbox 
        -Production()
- A small or medium we should go with LOW CODE approach . ( Generally flows is used to create automotion. If we do not have to we do not write code a lot.)
